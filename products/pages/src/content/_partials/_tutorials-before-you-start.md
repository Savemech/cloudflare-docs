## Before you continue 

All of the turorials assume you already have fundamental knowledge of [git](https://git-scm.com/). If you are new to git that's ok, pause and checkout this [summarized git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) on how to set up git on your machine with some of the helpful commands. 

If you clone with SSH, you must [generate SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.
